## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
Amil Wickramasinghe is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Fire Risk Modelling at the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment. His research focuses on developing spatially explicit fire risk forecasting methods for the forest regions of southeast Australia, utilising a combination of machine learning and process-based models. 

Dr. Wickramasinghe earned his PhD in Engineering from Victoria University, Australia, with a thesis titled Mapping Firebrand and Heat Flux on Structures in the Wildland-Urban Interface. His research introduced novel correlations to quantify firebrand attacks on structures under various fire weather conditions, with the aim of improving the Australian building standard AS3959.

In addition to his doctoral research, Amila holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in chemical and process engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. He has diverse industrial and academic experience, spanning coal power generation, wind power modelling, wildland fire modelling, water and wastewater treatment, process optimization and standardization, energy recovery and reuse, and textile dyeing and finishing in Sri Lanka, China, Germany, and Australia. Since 2023, he has also held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Tasmania, where his research focuses on wildfire modelling, particularly in the areas of firebrand transport, lightning ignitions, and fuel dryness.
